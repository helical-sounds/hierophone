# Hierophone

The Hierophone is an instrument designed around resonating a sheet of metal by placing it in an audio feedback loop. By changing the filtering of the audio, the phase and level of feedback, and manipulating the sheet directly, different overtones and sounds can be generated.

The name derives from ancient Greek, being the combination of ἱερά (hiera, 'holy') and φωνή (phōnē, 'voice'), together meaning "Holy Voice".
